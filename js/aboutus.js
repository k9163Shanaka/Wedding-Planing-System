We have grown by leaps and bounds since 2003 when Melissa coordinated her first wedding at the Admiral Kidd Club. We have since grown to six planners strong. We work together both individually and as a group to create beautiful, seamless events. While the company and our offerings have grown, many things remain the same.We are committed to a one-on-one, individual and customized approach to the planning process. Though we have many operational procedures to ensure a smooth event, we believe that every couple and every event is unique, and should be treated as such.";
